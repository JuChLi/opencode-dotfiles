$ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. Use the Skill tool to load the `test-driven-development` skill
2. Follow the cycle:
   - **RED**: Write one minimal failing test
   - **Verify RED**: Run test, confirm it fails for expected reason
   - **GREEN**: Write simplest code to pass
   - **Verify GREEN**: Run test, confirm all pass
   - **REFACTOR**: Clean up, keep tests green
   - **Repeat**: Next failing test
3. Never write production code without a failing test first
4. If you wrote code before test, delete it and start over
